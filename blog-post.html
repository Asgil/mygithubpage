            <h1>How to use public tweets to analyze OSN response for a topic.</h1>
            <p>All of us are concerned about our future and the future of our world. And as a huge part of our life, Social Networks reflect our opinion about important world events. I would like to show you how you can very simple track and analyse the response of Twitter users for any topic.</p>
            <p> I choose <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, because it has an easy to use and publicly available <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation">API</a> and because of it's nature which is to reflect in real-time world breaking events and news. </p>
            <p>As a topic I chose the current Presidential Elections Race in US, discussed all over the world. There are many different analytics about the topic, for example a very broad analysis of all of the news media <a href="http://www.electiontracker.us/">Election Tracker</a> by <a href="http://www.opentext.com/">OpenText Analytics</a>, but we will focus more on the regular user's social response for two major candidates: <b>Donald Trump</b> and <b>Hillary Clinton</b>. </p>
            <p>From the techical point of view, you will need  <a href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/">Python 3</a> and <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> installed on your preferred OS. All of the scripts needed to do what I wil describe you can find in my <a href="https://github.com/Asgil/Social_Network_Analysis">GitHub</a>.

                <p><h2>Step 1: Get the data.</h2></p>
                <p>First of all we need to connect to the Twitter API. Either directly, or via one of the available open source wrappers. Personally I prefer <a href="https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy">Tweepy</a> and will use it as an example.
                <a href="https://github.com/Asgil/Social_Network_Analysis/blob/master/twitter%20crawl/tweepy_streaming.py">Here</a> you can find a sample of the very simple streaming crawler, which allows you to track any keywords you would like. You have to modify the file by adding your credentials, which you got when you authorised an application (<a href="http://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/v3.5.0/auth_tutorial.html">authentication tutorial</a> can help you).</p>
                <section class="center">
                <img src="img/tw_tokens.png" width="200" vspace="10"   >
                </section>
                <p>
                    Then you choose the topic you would like to track and run the script with python3 by typing in your preferred terminal <b>$ python3 tweepy_streaming.py #YourHashtag</b>.
                </p>
                <p>For our analysis I chose two candidates for the President of the US <i>Hillary Clinton</i> and <i>Donald Trump</i>. I have collected tweets which contain the respective hashtags for 24 hours.
                </p>



            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="grid-6">
                <p><h2>Step 2: Extract the data.</h2></p>
                <p>Each tweet collected via the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview">Twitter API</a> returns a <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview/processing">json</a> of a <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets">tweet object</a>. There are many fields possible to analyze, but we will focus just on some of them, which I personally think would allow us to represent the public opinion and the validity of this opinion about one of our topics.
                </p>
                <p> <a href="https://github.com/Asgil/Social_Network_Analysis/blob/master/data%20extraction/metrics_extraction.py">Here</a> you can find a script that does all the below described steps. You can run it with python3 by typing in your terminal <b>$ python3 metrics_extraction.py topic_name path_to_the_json_file</b>.</p>
                <p><b>Reading the File.</b></p>
                <p>First we have to load the json file into memory. Usually, if the dataset is too big it's better to read file line by line and avoid storing all the data in memory, because it may not be sufficient. But here, we have a relatively small dataset and we are going to compute some metrics with relation to each other, so it makes sense to store all the tweet objects in memory.
                </p>
                <section class="center">
                <img src="img/read_file.png" width="500" vspace="10"  >
                </section>
                <p>Now we are ready to extract the data from each tweet.</p>
                <p><b>Extracting the Location. </b></p>
                <p>As an example, we will start with the
                <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/places">place</a> object. If there is a geolocation of the tweet, we can know from which country/city or any other place the tweet comes from. Let's see which locations are the most popular for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.</p>
                <section class="center">
                <img src="img/location.png" width="850" vspace="10"   >
                </section>
                <p>By saving the dictionary of location frequency to the file, we can later process it and create a <a href="http://worditout.com/word-cloud/make-a-new-one">word cloud</a> to see which locations are the most popular.</p>
                <p><b>Extracting the User Object. </b></p>
                <p>Now let's take a look at the users, who post those tweets. We already know that the majority of them come from the US (which is not surprising), but what else could we know about them?</p>
                <p>The answer is given in the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/users">user</a> object. Let us compute the number of users which are verified by Twitter, to see the fraction of trustworthy users talking about the Presidential Nominees.</p>
                <section class="center">
                <img src="img/users_verif.png" width="320" vspace="10">
                </section>
                <p> We can also compute the total audience of the tweets sent by all users in the dataset, so that we could get an approximate understanding of how many people would have been affected by the posts.</p>
                <section class="center">
                <img src="img/audience.png" width="600" vspace="10">
                </section>
                <p>The next thing is to look at the popularity of the user. How many people follow him and how many other accounts does he follow. For that I choose to compute the <i>friendship coefficient</i> as a ratio between the number of followers of a user and number of the accounts it follows. The <b>high</b> ratio means that the user is highly popular and the audience that sees the tweets from him could be big. The <b>small</b> ratio on the other hand would indicate a regular user, which is posting for his friends mostly.</p>
                <section class="center">
                <img src="img/users_friends.png" width="650" vspace="10">
                </section>
                <p><b>Extracting the Social Counts. </b></p>
                <p>Let us now check how much people agree on the posted tweets by calculating the total number of likes and the distribution. We will save the distribution dictionary to the file to further compute the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function">ECDF</a>. </p>
                <section class="center">
                <img src="img/likes.png" width="850" vspace="10">
                </section>
                <p><b>Extracting the Entities.</b></p>
                <p>Now let's take a closer look at the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets">tweet</a> object. Along with the regular metrics and user information which we processes earlier, tweet object contains an interesting attribute: <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/entities">entities</a>. Entities are <i>hashtags, mentions, media</i> and <i>urls</i>. This is the most important part of the tweet which can give you a very useful insight about the topic of the tweet, it's connections to other topics, twitter users involved in the conversation and etc., in case you don't want to use any text processing tools. In this post, I will focus on hashtags and mentions, because they are the easiest to process and they already can give us a lot of insight.
                </p>
                <p><b>Hashtags. </b></p>
                <p>For the hashtags, we will create the adjacency list of hashtags appearing in one tweet and calculate the overall frequency of a hashtag in the dataset.</p>
                <section class="center">
                <img src="img/hash_freq.png" width="650" vspace="10">
                </section>
                <p>It is also interesting to see, how hashtags are connected with each other and which pairs of hashtags are the most popular. For that we will count the frequency of all possible tuples of hashtags.</p>
                <section class="center">
                <img src="img/hash_adj.png" width="700"  vspace="10">
                </section>
                <p><b>Mentions. </b></p>
                <p>For the user mentions in tweets, the process will be the same as for the hashtags, we calculate the frequency of the mention and the adjacency lists of users mentioned together.</p>

                <p><h2>Step 3: Make conclusions.</h2></p>
                <p><b>General statistics.</b></p>
                <section class="center">
                <img src="img/stat.png" width="550"  vspace="10">
                </section>
                <p>In our 24h dataset we see approximately the same number of tweets for both candidates, but if we start to look further, we notice that for example, tweets about Hillary Clinton have less verified users, which says that more public figures discuss Donald Trump. In addition, we can notice a significant difference in audience amount and response for the tweets. Tweets about Donald Trump have twice as big audience and twice as many likes as tweets about Hillary Clinton.</p>
                <p><b>Location.</b></p>
                <p>Previously calculated location frequency we can visualize by making a word cloud of locations according the number of times it appears in the dataset.</p>
                <section class="center">
                <img src="img/location_w.png" width="700" vspace="10">
                </section>
                <p> We clearly see that users from US prevail in both datasets, but also we can notice that countries of users discussing Donald Trump are more diverse.</p>
                <p><b>Audience estimation.</b></p>
                <p>We already saw that the possible audience to see posts about Donald Trump is two times bigger than the audience for Hillary Clinton, but can we get more information?</p>
                <p>To see if there's something else different between the audiences, we can plot the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function">ECDF</a> function. <a href="https://github.com/Asgil/Social_Network_Analysis/commit/675afa565f1c23daeb116cc4665f35fe438397d3">Here</a> is a code to generate the plots in R from the files we created previously. </p>
                <p>On the plot we can see that the general distributions of the number of followers per each user found in two datasets are very similar. Since we know that all OSN's are <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/~mmarcon/SocialNetworks-IMC.pdf">proven</a> to preserve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">power law</a>, to extract more information, we need to look at the outliers.</p>
                <section class="center">
                <img src="img/audience_cdf.png" width="800"  vspace="10">
                </section>
                <p>For that I prefer to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function#Complementary_cumulative_distribution_function_.28tail_distribution.29">CCDF</a>. On the CCDF plot we can clearly see the difference between two distributions, which supports the claim that users posting about Donald Trump has larger audiences not only because there are more users in the dataset, but also because there are several accounts with much more significant number of followers than in the dataset for Hillary Clinton. This also follows the analysis of the <a href="http://www.electiontracker.us/compare.html?lid=13&rid=3&pid=0">Election Tracker</a> where it's clearly seen that media tend to discuss Donald Trump more than Hillary Clinton. Now we can see that the situation on Twitter is similar.
                <section class="center">

                <p><b>Social Counts.</b></p>
                <p>Now let's look if the number of likes for the post in the dataset is also biased by the long tail effect, as the audience size.</p>
                <section class="center">
                <img src="img/likes_cdf.png" width="800" vspace="10">
                </section>
                <p>On this CDF you see that the distribution of likes per tweet for Hillary Clinton tweets preserves the power law, but for the Donald Trump we clearly see that there are three tweets with a significantly bigger number of likes than the others. The most liked one comes from the verified user <a href="https://twitter.com/salmahayek?lang=en">@salmahayek</a> who expresses her opinion about the recent news.</p>

                <p><b>Popularity of hashtags.</b></p>
                <p>If we want to see which topics prevail in the discussion about both candidates, we can take a look at the word cloud of single hashtag popularity and the popularity of the tuples of hashtags.</p>

                <p>Donald Trump is connected with recent discussions about Brexit and he was compared to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson">Boris Johnson</a>, and Hillary Clinton is mostly compared to Donald Trump and a lot of hashtags with different sentiment: <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ImWithHer&src=tyah">#ImWithHer</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NeverHillary&src=tyah">#NeverHillary</a> as an example. </p>
                <p><b>Popularity of mentions.</b></p>
                <p>As the last part of our analysis we can also look at the popularity of accounts mentioned in tweets. For both of the candidates most frequently mentioned accounts are a <a href="https://twitter.com/ConnorGillies">journalist</a> and news media sites: <a href="https://twitter.com/LBC">LBC</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNews">Fox News</a>. This can mean that Twitter is no more a place of a regular users' conversations, but a news aggregator. </p>

                <p>This analysis may lead to different conclusions, especially if we dig deeper and conduct textual analysis, or analysis of embedded URLs. But even now I think this information is enough to get some understanding about people's response to the US Election on Twitter.</p>

        In this post I tried to show my approach to the OSN analysis for some topic. Of course, there are many other approaches, including <a href="https://www.feicho.com/watson-alchemy-twitter-analysis-us-presidential-election/">sentiment analysis</a> or <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2012/predicting-twitter-trending-topics-1101">prediction of trending topics</a> but I like the simplicity of the tweet content analysis and low entry levels to start Social Network analysis without strong programming or analytical skills.
